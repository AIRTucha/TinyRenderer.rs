## What does each file do?

* `Cargo.toml` contains the standard Rust metadata. You put your Rust dependencies in here. You must change this file with your details (name, description, version, authors, categories)

* `package.json` contains the standard npm metadata. You put your JavaScript dependencies in here. You must change this file with your details (author, name, version)

* `webpack.config.js` contains the Webpack configuration. You shouldn't need to change this, unless you have very special needs.

* The `js` folder contains your JavaScript code (`index.js` is used to hook everything into Webpack, you don't need to change it).
